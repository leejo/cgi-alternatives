NAME
    CGI::Alternatives - Documentation for alternative solutions to CGI.pm

VERSION
    0.01

DESCRIPTION
    This module doesn't do anything, it exists solely to document
    alternatives to the CGI module. This documentation is a work in
    progress, an example script will be shown in raw CGI.pm and then the
    equivalent implementation for each alternative will be shown. Resources
    to further information and documentation will also be included.

BUT WHY?
    CGI.pm hasn't been considered good practice for many years, and there
    have been alternatives available for web development in perl for a long
    time. Despite this there are still some perl developers that will
    recommend the use of CGI.pm for web development and prototyping. The two
    main arguments for the use of CGI.pm, often given by those developers,
    are no longer true:

    1) "CGI.pm is a core module so you don't have install anything extra."
    This is now incorrect:

            http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/e9fa5a80

    If you are doing any serious web development you are going to have to
    use external dependencies, DBI is not in the core for example.

    2) "CGI.pm scripts are shorter and simpler than alternative
    implementations." Again, not true and the following examples will show
    that.
